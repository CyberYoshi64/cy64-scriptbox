'''systemX.dat''' is the name of [[Mario Kart 7]]'s save data file. It is stored on the cartridge or on the SD card, depending where the game is booted from. Usually, two of these files are stored in the save filesystem: '''systemX.dat''' and '''systemX+1.dat''', where "X" = a number from 0 to 9. ''systemX+1.dat'' is the latest save data while '''systemX.dat''' serves as a backup, if the former is to be rejected. If both files are rejected or missing, the game formats the save data and generates a new save file with default values with number 1. Most of the time, the number will increment after the game writes to the save, wrapping around to 0, if the number would be greater than 9.

The class that controls this file in the code is '''System::SystemSaveData'''

== File Format ==
The file has a fixed size of 0x50D4 bytes.

=== RankingSaveData ===

=== GrandPrixData ===
'''GrandPrixData''' contains a list of 32 bytes, one for every cup and every engine class. It stores different settings, such as the trophy obtained and the star ranking. Each bit is formatted as follows:

TTTS SSSC

where:
* '''TTT''' = Trophy type
* '''SSSS''' = Rank (RaceSys::EGrandPrixRecord)
* '''C''' = Completed flag. 0 = not completed, 1 = completed.

=== OpponentList ===
'''OpponentList''' consists of a list of 100 '''OpponentData''' entries, each representing an opponent found online. This is the list of Miis seen in the Friend / Opponents list from the Online menu.

==== OpponentData ====
Each entry corresponds to an opponent found online. It is 0xA8 bytes long.

(1): These values are responsible for the unlock animation in the menu.
Note that the game only checks for one bit, starting with the characters from the most-significant bit to the least-significant bit.
If the dedicated bit in the main bitmask is not set, the bit is ignored.
