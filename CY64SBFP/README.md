# CyberYoshi64's SmileBASIC File Parser

This is a work-in-progress Python script that can parse files used in
SmileBASIC 3 and 4. Currently, it only allows you to check the header contents
and see whether a file would be considered valid by SmileBASIC.

Supported platforms: Linux

Modules needed: `opencv-python`, `struct`, `numpy`

See `python cy64-ptcfm.py --help` for arguments. There are quite a few of them planned (a few actually work right now).

If it doesn't work and you can help with the script, please file an issue. **Pull requests could be used, but cannot be merged, due to the way my Git setup works**
