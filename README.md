# CY64 ScriptBox

This repository contains random scripts and other tiny projects not deserving a seperate repository.

## Individual objects

### CTGP7-Updater-experimental

This is an experimental version of [the CTGP-7 Updater Tool](https://github.com/CyberYoshi64/CTGP7-UpdateTool) that's not meant for production and moreso for me to experiment with features.

### CY64SBFP

> CY64 SmileBASIC File Parser

Self-explanatory, I have to say.

### SB3-DS-Projects

A backup of the download repo of the SmileBASIC Download Station.

### SB-Download-Station

- 0.0.4 - Latest stable release
- latest - broken build but most up-to-date source

**Plan:** Merge it with [SmileBASIC-CYX](https://github.com/CyberYoshi64/PTC3-Plugin) inside a dedicated launcher. Alternatively, just use [SBServer](https://github.com/Trinitro21/sbserver) and a web API.

### nw4c-textureConverter.py

This is made by observations of TGA files made by `NW4C_TextureConverter.exe` and improves it slightly.

Requirements: `pillow`

### ctr-configblock.py

Read `config` and extract config blocks or inject data into them.

Refer to the `-h` switch for help.

### 3dnus.py

A simple C#-to-Python port of the [3DNUS core](https://github.com/DrHacknik/3DNUS) for use on Linux.

Requirements: `shutil`, [`make_cdn_cia` (seperate program)](https://github.com/DavidSouthgate/make_cdn_cia)

Refer to the `-h` switch for help.

### ctrDummyCfgSet

It just makes hardcoded changes to the 3DS `config` file through a homebrew. Use and edit at your own risk.
