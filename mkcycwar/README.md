## Warning

Although the code has some attempts to be compatibile with Windows, I cannot garantuee that this code works on Windows or macOS.

If it doesn't, you can file an issue to help me making it compatible. **Pull requests could be used, but cannot be merged, due to the way my Git setup works**
