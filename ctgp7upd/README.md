# CTGP-7 Updater Script

Note: **This script was not verified by the CTGP-7 team. Use this tool at your own risk.**

This is a work-in-progress Python script mimicking CTGP-7's official updater, based on own observations, analysis of the [archived launcher's source code](https://github.com/PabloMK7/CTGP-7_Launcher) and a bit of help from PabloMK7 himself.

Supported platforms: Linux

Modules needed: `requests`, `time`

Syntax: `python ctgp7upd.py [folder] [-h] [-p] [-s] [-a]`

- `folder` — Path to a valid CTGP-7 folder to update in
- `-h` — Show this help
- `-p` — Show full path of downloaded file
- `-s` — Show files removed/renamed (Name will change color appropriately)
- `-a` — Same behaviour as `-p -s`

If `folder` isn't specified as an argument, the script will ask for a valid path, which can also be used to drag'n'drop the CTGP-7 folder in the prompt or enter the path to the CTGP-7 folder, inclusive.

## Warning

Although the code has some attempts to be compatibile with Windows, I cannot garantuee that this code works on Windows or macOS.

If compatibility is uncertain, *please make a backup of your CTGP-7 installation and other important data from your 3DS's SD Card*, although SD Card corruption stemming from this tool should not be the case. It has several protections from corrupting files that aren't finished downloading.
If it doesn't work and you can help with the script, please file an issue. **Pull requests could be used, but cannot be merged, due to the way my Git setup works**

## Author notes

### Where's my progress bar?

Standard Python `requests` do not make use of callback/intermediary functions while they're processing. Unless I move to another module and learn its command set, this is the best I can do.

### How updates exactly work in this script

The script first downloads the changelog, reads all the version numbers and dedicated info into a tuple list, to then check the local version against the list.

From there, if the version is outdated, I read all file lists up to the latest version to then download and insert in the main loop.

After that's done, I edit the version file to reflect the changes appropriately. (Don't confuse the official launcher to redownload the update.)

However, if the update includes a new launcher package, the user is told to install the new launcher themself. ***This script is not capable to install the CIA for the user. Only the 3DSX is able to be copied over, which this tool isn't doing either, at the moment.***

### Why is its output so confined and clean?

While I originally wanted this to be more duck-taped, PabloMK7 kicked my motivation to make this updater as true to the official updater as I can, this also includes the console output looking clean.

### What on earth is this code looking like?

The way I coded it, is quite rubbish, but I'll refine the codeflow over time.
